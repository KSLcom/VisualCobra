Visual Cobra Express
====================

Setup instructions
------------------

Visual Cobra Express is an integrated development environment (ICE) for the Cobra programming language. It is based on
Microsoft Visual Studio's isloated shell and runs on Microsoft Windows.

1. Install the Cobra programming language from cobra-language.com.

2. Ensure that the Cobra executable has been added to your path (i.e. so you can type cobra in a command window and it will run).

3. Download and install the Visual Studio 2010 Isolated Shell Redistributable from Microsoft (warning -- this is BIG).

4. Create a folder for your Visual Cobra Express installation and extract all the files from VisualCobra\Release into it.

5. Double-click Visual Cobra Express.exe to run it.
   You should get a splash screen and then an integrated development environment.

6. Drag in the sample .cobra file.
   If the installation was successful, this should be displayed with coloured syntax highlighting.

7. Select "Cobra | Run using Cobra" from the menu.
   The results should be as follows:
rehfynedkn
zdopvwrqph
rexclerbay
nsjwlafkvf
mvrjpcjysn
yhgkynheut
vccmzgtsdu
rhujvvnnni
usjnzgmzxy
saqbkjsfji

8. You can now use Visual Cobra Express to develop your own projects.

TODOs
=====
This is the first release of this software. There are several planned enhancements.

* We need to add template projects and files, with boilerplate code to get you up and running more quickly.
* It would be useful to have an installer instead of these manual steps.
* At present, managing multi-file projects is very manual (e.g. you have to manually set the command to run from the Cobra menu).
  This should be made easier.
